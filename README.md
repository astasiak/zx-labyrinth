Simple web game written to practice using Scala, Play, Akka, MongoDB and AngularJS.

### How to play?

**1. CREATE/JOIN GAME**   
First of all, in order to play, you have to either create or join an already existing game.  
After you find your opponent and start a game, there are just simple steps to play (and win):

**2. PUT YOUR WALLS**  
At the beginning, you've got to put some walls into your labirynth. Everytime you click somewhere between labirynth cells, it will put another wall in a place you want. Your goal here is to make the labirynth as hard as possible!

**3. GOING INTO EACH OTHERS LABIRYNTHS**  
Now it is your chance (and your foe's).  
Use arrows to go out of your opponent's labirynth. Be careful, if you hit a wall, your turn is OVER.
