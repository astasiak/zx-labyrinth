Simple web game written to practice using Scala, Play, Akka, MongoDB and AngularJS.

### How to play?

**1. JOIN OR CREATE GAME**   
First of all, in order to play, you have to either create or join an already existing game.  
After you find your opponent and start a game, there are just simple steps to play (and win):

**2. PUT YOUR WALLS**  
At the beginning, you've got to put some walls into your labirynth. Each click somewhere between labirynth cells will put a wall in a place you want. Remember: your goal is to make your labirynth as hard as possible!

**3. GO INTO ENEMY'S LABIRYNTH**
